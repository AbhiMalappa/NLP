"it took over 20hours to resolve lis issue that affected patient care; poor service, poor communication.",long_holdtime
"on an additional note: this call took place on a sunday, when there was no wait queue.",long_holdtime
i called back this morning (monday) for a separate issue and was in a wait queue for way too long.,long_holdtime
"the assistance from the 'chat' session on service now was not satisfactory - the amount of time it took was almost an hour (long lapses between chat exchanges), it did not answer my original request (difficulty populating the support group in a directed service request), which resulted in the chat technician opening the ticket for me that he directed to the wrong support group.",long_holdtime
"Rep resolved the issue quickly however, i was on hold for over 30 minutes.",long_holdtime
long hold time when i couldnt sign into the computer to start the day.,long_holdtime
"the rep who helped me was very nice and got it all handled but the hold time was outrageous , i know it happens but i was on hold over an hour",long_holdtime
hold time was about 35 minutes,long_holdtime
the only issue that i had was that i needed to waiting 1.5 hours on hold before i was able to speak with a tech support person.,long_holdtime
i am sure that the new year brought all kinds of challenges to the staff but it is worth mentioning the wait time that i am sure that you are already aware of.,long_holdtime
i waited for over an hour to get assistance.,long_holdtime
too long  to wait.,long_holdtime
i was on hold for 1 hr 26 minutes,long_holdtime
"however the wait time to get that help, was terrible.",long_holdtime
"was waiting for 1/2 hr first time i called, then about 15 min.",long_holdtime
i had been on hold waiting for the help desk to answer for 35 minutes to have my ibm password reset.,long_holdtime
"my staff have experienced these same issues in the past, but were on hold for 4 hours at a time before being disconnected.",long_holdtime
40 mins and still on hold.,long_holdtime
the one piece that was negative about this experience:  the wait time on hold before a human could talk to me.,long_holdtime
"hold time was 15-20 min, after that, things went face.",long_holdtime
"production server down, but after 2 hours no one had been assigned, so i had to escalate to get someone assigned to restart it.",long_holdtime
"after hanging up after a 30 min wait til, i realized the issues was not resolved.",long_holdtime
so i am on hold again to attempt a second time for help.,long_holdtime
"other than the wait time of 30 minutes (high volume on a monday after the holiday = understood), the service was great!",long_holdtime
the wait time for a service representative was 2 hours...and the hold music leaves a lot to be desired.,long_holdtime
"i spent 2 hours on the phone yesterday with hr/ecos experts, none of whom could resolve and they said it is a national problem and submit a basic ticket, which i did.",long_holdtime
"wait on hold to get an analyst was 25 minutes with no update messages stating all agents busy, time in queue, etc.",long_holdtime
it would be helpful to receive periodic updates when on hold for this long so users know there isn't an issue getting transferred to an analyst.,long_holdtime
because i didn't state that this was an emergency i was on hold for 14 minutes before someone answered the phone.,long_holdtime
"once the phone was answered it took less than 2 minutes., so the bad mark is due to the time i had to sit on hold and listen to crappy music.",long_holdtime
the wait time to call the help desk is really unacceptable so this is great.,long_holdtime
"the wait time was unusually long, but the service provided was good.",long_holdtime
too long waiting on hold when im in clinic and helping mbrs face to face.,long_holdtime
"the time thing was not great (i rated it a ""7"") but i understand and can wait my turn.",long_holdtime
longer wait time than ideal but dina was very professional,long_holdtime
i tried using the chat with it functionality first and didn't get a response after waiting 5 minutes so then called the help desk.,long_holdtime
i was on hold with the help desk for 45 minutes initially.,long_holdtime
once i got an analyst they had to get help from their lead which took another 15 minutes.,long_holdtime
i spent an hour trying to get one simple question answered about category directed service now request.,long_holdtime
however it was 40 minutes to wait on hold before being helped.,long_holdtime
it was worth the wait.,long_holdtime
it was a long wait (closer to 60mins.),long_holdtime
hold time was way longer than resolving my issue.,long_holdtime
it just took sooooooooooooo long to reach a tech.,long_holdtime
at least 20 minutes.,long_holdtime
my only disappointment is the amount of time i had to wait.,long_holdtime
my wait time was in excess of minutes.,long_holdtime
i was on hold for 43 minutes before getting a technician.,long_holdtime
the only negative issue i had was with how long i had to remain on hold to get help.,long_holdtime
i waited on hold for over 40 minutes before someone came on.,long_holdtime
the waiting time was a bit long.,long_holdtime
time on hold to speak to an analyst was to long.,long_holdtime
just the wait time was long to get a person at the service desk.,long_holdtime
waiting on the phone on hold for nearly an hour.,long_holdtime
give her a 10.  waiting 20 minutes for an online chat is not so great.,long_holdtime
was on hold for more than 1 hour+ and still wasn't able to connect with someone,long_holdtime
for some reason there was not a call back option offered...i was on hold for an interminable amount of time....once i reached a representative it was addressed quickly and efficiently.,long_holdtime
had to hold for 1 hour (bad service).,long_holdtime
especially after waiting 45 mins to get serviced.,long_holdtime
i think it service should be restored to a local area service center where in the past we would wait less than 5 minutes for assistance.,long_holdtime
also the self service portal does not allow for people who have phone numbers with an extension to request for a call back instead of waiting hours and days on the phone line.,long_holdtime
"i was on hold for almost an hour, way too long!",long_holdtime
"wait time was a little long, but other than that, the issue was resolved.",long_holdtime
"i did have to wait 30 minutes in order to receive a service desk agent, but the agent was pleasant and helpful, which made up for the unusual long wait.",long_holdtime
the issue was the wait time.,long_holdtime
i called in twice and overall had a wait time of over 1 hour.,long_holdtime
wait time to obtain ticket request extremely long!,long_holdtime
i was surprised it took so long to receive a call back.,long_holdtime
"after hours, took a little bit longer then usual to get connected",long_holdtime
long hold wait times.,long_holdtime
it would be nice if there was an automated notification in the hold about estimated time of wait or how many callers were ahead of you to help caller manage time.,long_holdtime
only complaint is that i had to wait on hold to speak to the first representative for 15 minutes.,long_holdtime
the hold time for a technician was unusually long.,long_holdtime
the wait time to call the national help desk line is too long,long_holdtime
time to connect to an agent to help me was 52 minutes.,long_holdtime
would have given much higher ratings overall if i hadn't had to wait 52 minutes to get help.,long_holdtime
call wait times were the only issue,long_holdtime
the hold time was horrendous,long_holdtime
"waiting time to get to someone, however, was long.",long_holdtime
i was on hold for 45 mins.,long_holdtime
the rep was excellent however the hold was extremely too long,long_holdtime
"long wait time; fixed quickly by friendly, efficient staff",long_holdtime
"my co-worker had me try re-starting the one-drive app, which worked and took about 2 minutes.",long_holdtime
"i had been on the phone with the first support person for 30 minutes, and the level 2 person wanted me to take my laptop to a AA building.",long_holdtime
i waited on hold over 40 minutes to speak to someone.,long_holdtime
i waited on hold x 30 minutes and then got disconnected with chat due to inactivity.,long_holdtime
was placed back into queue where i waited another 15-20 mins.,long_holdtime
the wait time was a bit long but acceptable since i can work on something else for the time being.,long_holdtime
on hold for over 35 minutes before i switched to option #1 even though it wasn't a pt-related issue.,long_holdtime
had no choice because i couldn't stay on hold any longer.,long_holdtime
"i was on the phone for over an hour and quite honestly, i didn't feel like the tech had a clue what he was doing.",long_holdtime
"volume calls, waited a bit too long, patients waited 26minutes.",long_holdtime
the only negative was that i was on hold for over 30 minutes b4 a technician came on the line.,long_holdtime
the only downside was the hold time >20mins.,long_holdtime
otherwise the problem was remedied in a matter of a few minutes.,long_holdtime
"unfortunately, i was on hold for 1 hour 3 minutes.",long_holdtime
i waited over an hour to speak with someone at the service desk and then over 30 mins to place the ticket and the advanced technical support just closed the ticket and didn't resolve my issue.,long_holdtime
"yesterday, 1/11/21, i waited 40 minutes to speak with an it representative, so i ended up hanging up.",long_holdtime
"today, i waited less than 5 minutes.",long_holdtime
you might want to increase your staffing during the daytime hours.,long_holdtime
"hold times before service desk are very long, but once we are connected they have been very helpful, friendly and super fast.",long_holdtime
i had to be called back due to long holds.,long_holdtime
took 2 months to repair which was way too long for business support.,long_holdtime

so i am on hold again to attempt a second time for help.,long_holdtime

the wait time for a service representative was 2 hours...and the hold music leaves a lot to be desired.,long_holdtime
"i spent 2 hours on the phone yesterday with hr/ecos experts, none of whom could resolve and they said it is a national problem and submit a basic ticket, which i did.",long_holdtime
"wait on hold to get an analyst was 25 minutes with no update messages stating all agents busy, time in queue, etc.",long_holdtime
it would be helpful to receive periodic updates when on hold for this long so users know there isn't an issue getting transferred to an analyst.,long_holdtime
because i didn't state that this was an emergency i was on hold for 14 minutes before someone answered the phone.,long_holdtime
"once the phone was answered it took less than 2 minutes., so the bad mark is due to the time i had to sit on hold and listen to crappy music.",long_holdtime
the wait time to call the help desk is really unacceptable so this is great.,long_holdtime
"the wait time was unusually long, but the service provided was good.",long_holdtime

once i got an analyst they had to get help from their lead which took another 15 minutes.,long_holdtime
i spent an hour trying to get one simple question answered about category directed service now request.,long_holdtime

had to hold for 1 hour (bad service).,long_holdtime
especially after waiting 45 mins to get serviced.,long_holdtime
i think it service should be restored to a local area service center where in the past we would wait less than 5 minutes for assistance.,long_holdtime
also the self service portal does not allow for people who have phone numbers with an extension to request for a call back instead of waiting hours and days on the phone line.,long_holdtime
"i was on hold for almost an hour, way too long!",long_holdtime
"wait time was a little long, but other than that, the issue was resolved.",long_holdtime
"i did have to wait 30 minutes in order to receive a service desk agent, but the agent was pleasant and helpful, which made up for the unusual long wait.",long_holdtime
the issue was the wait time.,long_holdtime
i called in twice and overall had a wait time of over 1 hour.,long_holdtime

i was surprised it took so long to receive a call back.,long_holdtime
"after hours, took a little bit longer then usual to get connected",long_holdtime

the hold time for a technician was unusually long.,long_holdtime
the wait time to call the national help desk line is too long,long_holdtime

the wait time was a bit long but acceptable since i can work on something else for the time being.,long_holdtime
on hold for over 35 minutes before i switched to option #1 even though it wasn't a pt-related issue.,long_holdtime
had no choice because i couldn't stay on hold any longer.,long_holdtime
"i was on the phone for over an hour and quite honestly, i didn't feel like the tech had a clue what he was doing.",long_holdtime
"volume calls, waited a bit too long, patients waited 26minutes.",long_holdtime
the only negative was that i was on hold for over 30 minutes b4 a technician came on the line.,long_holdtime
the only downside was the hold time >20mins.,long_holdtime
otherwise the problem was remedied in a matter of a few minutes.,long_holdtime
"unfortunately, i was on hold for 1 hour 3 minutes.",long_holdtime
i waited over an hour to speak with someone at the service desk and then over 30 mins to place the ticket and the advanced technical support just closed the ticket and didn't resolve my issue.,long_holdtime
"yesterday, 1/11/21, i waited 40 minutes to speak with an it representative, so i ended up hanging up.",long_holdtime
"today, i waited less than 5 minutes.",long_holdtime

its been two days and several hours waiting on hold at 877-457-4772 to resolve issues with transactions in the new hrconnect.,long_holdtime

the only it help desk issue that still is happening is that i had to wait on-hold for 30 minutes before connecting to an actual person.,long_holdtime
"second try, i left my number for a call back, i called back but was placed on hold again for 20mins.",long_holdtime
"long wait but once technician attended the call, my issue was resolved timely",long_holdtime

only neg takeaway was the wait time i was caring for pts and to be on hold for over an hour is unacceptable,long_holdtime
"two comments: 1 - on the help desk, please hire more techs as the wait times mean someone or something is not working.",long_holdtime
the hold time was 45 minutes to fix something that took 2 minutes to fix.,long_holdtime

the wait time is too long.,long_holdtime

"i just wanted to follow up with them with more information 5 minutes after i hung up from the call and i was not able to reach back to them, however the national help desk wait time was ok when i first submitted my incident",long_holdtime

"first call disconnected, second call on hold for 39 minutes and disconnected and third time worked.",long_holdtime

"hold time on the phone was a little long, but the person who helped me was great, and even though he couldn't resolve the issue it was resolved super quickly after he escalated it.",long_holdtime
i was on hold with the help desk for 1hr and 10mins.,long_holdtime
the score of 8 is solely based on wait-time to get to speak with an it representative.,long_holdtime

"also the update to the laptop was unexpected and occurred during work hours so it was disruptive to my patient care, and i don't understand why access would be denied if the computer went through an update.",long_holdtime
i was on hold for almost 2 hours.,long_holdtime
this is the only part that lowered my satisfaction scores on this process (besides for the same song playing over and over again when on hold).,long_holdtime
i was on hold for over 50 minutes and hung up.,long_holdtime
"on my third try today, i was so happy to have zachary take my call after a few minutes.",long_holdtime

the only issue is having to wait 10 minutes or so once a chart is closed by lts.,long_holdtime
i am also very happy that my wait time was not more than 10 minutes.,long_holdtime
wait time said it was 'more than 10 minutes' so i opted to use the call me back method.,long_holdtime

i was on the phone for a very long time 30 minutes that's too long,long_holdtime

the only disadvantage was having to wait for the phone to be answered.,long_holdtime
there was a 30 minute wait and i had to leave the phone often to room patient's.,long_holdtime
i left the tech off the phone too quickly and now i’m back on hold again for more than 15 minutes and counting!,long_holdtime

"This ticket took almost 2 weeks to 'resolve' which wasn't actually resolved.  The tech's solution, once he actually had the ticket just pinged me my bitlocker key, which I already have.  The issue with this ticket was that the usb mouse and hub triggers the bit locker key screen to come up every time I restart my computer.  It didn't matter if it was plugged in directly into the computer or the docking station.  The first tech that was assigned my ticket had to send this back out to the refresh team because he didn't have rights to my computer, even though I've had the new refresh for about a month.  12 days later, I only get a ping from the tech with just my bitlocker key and when I told him the issue that I was actually having, his response was that I need to open a new ticket AGAIN so that it can get resolved.  The level of professionalism of this refresh team is pretty ridiculous at this point.  Clearly no one cares if they do the right job or not, only that they can close the ticket and say it's resolved, even when it isn't.  Now I have to open another ticket, maybe even multiple tickets and wait again for someone to MAYBE pick up my ticket and do their job.  Also - taking almost two weeks to get a bitlocker key is actually pretty ridiculous.  Anyone that has been stuck on that screen knows without the key you pretty much have a brick.  The fact that it took this long would have meant that I didn't have a working computer for weeks if that was my singular issue.  The way this whole thing has been handled is quite disappointing and expect more from a team that is rolling out new computers to the masses.  Apparently the only solution is to pass the buck.",no_resolution
